Description: Given a data frame of which each row containing the first 10 core 
             stocks of a portfolio, convert it to a matrix with its rownames 
             being the names of all core stocks in the data frame, and the rest 
             of rows marking whether this core stock appears in the 
             corresponding portfolio with 1 and 0. Meanwhile there might be 
             false data in some portfolios, and we find them and correct them.
